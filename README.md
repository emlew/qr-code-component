## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - For styles

### What I learned

This project helped me reinforce my grasp on CSS and HTML. I particularly enjoyed declaring variables in CSS with the following snippet:

```css
:root {
    font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
    --white: #fff;
    --light-blue: #D6E2F0;
    --gray: #7B879D;
    --navy: #1F3251;
  }
```

I had to pay special attention to the footer links as well. A quick `color: var(--navy);` allowed me to make sure that they were the same color as the unlinked text.

### Continued development

I would love to see how this design could be improved on mobile, or be built  more reactively.

### Useful resources

- [Box-shadow doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This helped me understand placement and color of the drop shadow on the QR container.
